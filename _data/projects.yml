    With <mark>Prestashop</mark> as the base I’ve added numerous features and fixes to fit our needs for the shop, both by coding standalone modules and overwritting core funcionally.

    Additionally, I’ve made a backoffice with <mark>Python</mark> that integrates and syncs the product stock with the providers, and automates tasks that are tedious or impossible to do within Prestashop.

    Being that this project is live, I also manage the hosting and everything related (CDN, Deployments, etc). *There is planed a migration to Scaleway's* <mark>kubernetes</mark> *in the short term*.

    Design, marketing and most of the non-technical duties are managed by my partner [Iván Sol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-sol/).

    Using <mark>Prestashop</mark> as the base I’ve developed numerous features and fixes within PS to add the functionality needed for the shop, both standalone modules and overwritting core funcionally.

    Additionally, parallel to the running shop I’ve developed a backoffice on <mark>Python</mark> that integrates and syncs the product stock with the providers and automates tasks that tedious or impossible to do within Prestashop.

    Being  that this project is live, I also manage the hosting and everything related (CDN, Deployments, etc). *There is planed a migration to Scaleway's* <mark>kubernetes</mark> *in the short term*.

    Design, marketing and most of the non-technical duties are managed by my partner [Iván Sol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-sol/).
